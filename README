1. Introduction

In this project, a BF routing algorithm is implemented to simulate the
routing tables. 

The routing tables and distance vectors are implemented using concurrent
hashmap. 

The features are:
- All the commands in the part 1 of assigment decription are implemented
- Poison reverse is implemented to avoid count to infinity
- File transfer: correctly

2. How to run the code

Run the make file the compile the project:

make

Then run the entry file:

java BFclient <name of config file>

3. Sample Commands (all in upper case):

(1) LINKDOWN <ip_address> <port>
(2) LINKUP <ip_address> <port>
(3) CHANGECOST <ip_address> <port> <new cost>
(4) SHOWRT
(5) CLOSE
(6) TRANSFER <file name> <ip address> <port>
	- The new file in the destination will be renamed as <original name>_transfered.blabla
	- Assume that the file size will not exceed 100000 Bytes.
